Aiming to reclaim the title and reproveâ€‚his superiority in the division
He has suffered more than a fewâ€‚setbacks, including a knockout loss to Islam Makhachev in late 2023. Despite these difficulties, Volkanovski is still one of the most experienced and determined fighters inâ€‚the UFCâ€™s featherweight ranks.
Diego Lopes:
Age: 30
Hot prospect ridingâ€‚a five-fight winning streak.
Known for a developed mix of aggressive striking and high-caliberâ€‚submission skills.
His most recent victories include a unanimous decision win over formerâ€‚title challenger Brian Ortega in September 2024.
Considered by many to be one of the most dangerous and versatile competitors inâ€‚the featherweight ranks, Lopes gets a stylistic puzzle to solve in this bout.
The winner of this bout will walk away not only with the featherweight title, but also with a clear path to what the futureâ€‚holds for the division. Volkanovskiâ€™s experience and pastâ€‚title reign makes him popular among many fans, but Lopesâ€™ assuredness and all-around skill set makes him a real threat.
